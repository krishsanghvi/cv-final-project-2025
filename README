A Neural Network Classifier for Wildlife Re-Identification (DeiT-based)
Installation instructions:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/krishsanghvi/cv-final-project-2025.git

Model:
Model is trained in model.py. The specific model we used in our project is facebook/deit-base-distilled-patch16-224.

Test Examples:
A sample dataset of 3 images can be see in the training_data folder.

Data Augmentation Code:
Data preprocessing and augmentation is done in create_data.ipynb.

How to Run the Code
Step 1: Download datasets and AnimalCLEF-2025 competition data in the first cell in create_data.ipynb
Step 2: Prepare the dataset by extracting Lynx, Salamander, and Turtle images and storing into species folders in cells 2-4 in create_data.ipynb
Step 3: Augment the data to reach 30,000 images per species in cell 6 in create_data.ipynb
Step 4: Run cell 7 in create_data.ipynb to create the final CSV (full_image_identity.csv)
Step 5: Train a DeiT (Data-efficient Image Transformer) for classification which contains 65% training, 15% validation, 20% testing in model.py
Step 6: After training, evaluate on a test set which will generate a classification report
